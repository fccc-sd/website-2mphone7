        Hello, and welcome to my page. I'm currently a senior and a computer programming student at Four County Career Center (FCCC). I like gaming and I'm heavily interested in the field of computer science and plan to make a career out of it.
        <br> Outside of those interests, I participate in extracurriculars like cross country running and track. A few things to know about me are: I am not well versed in conversations, and I prefer doing background work, 
        which is partially the reason I chose computer science as a career of interest. I'm experienced with operating a computer and wanted to know more about how websites are made and how to code.

        Games that I enjoy playing.
        <ul>
            <li>Phasmophobia</li>
            <li>Roblox</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>GD</li>
            <li>Risk of Rain 2</li>
        </ul>

        Along with those games, I have over 25 games on Steam that I bought over a year ago and half of them I have never played. 
        Two things about me is that I have a procrastination issue and I don't really like trying new things.
