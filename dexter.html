            Dexter is a show about Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter analyst working for the Miami Metro Police Department by day, and a serial killer hunting other serial killers at night.
            It has won several Primetime Emmy Awards and many nominations. This review will combine all shows that are part of the Franchise, including Dexter (2006-2013), Dexter: New Blood (2021-22),
            Dexter: Original Sin (2024-25), and Dexter: Resurrection (2025-ongoing). These reviews will have spoilers but given that this is a review website, this should be expected.

        <div class="season11title"> <h1> 1. <br> Season 11 - Dexter: Resurrection (2025)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season11text"> Dexter: Resurrection Season 1 wasn't expected to be this good when the trailer first came out. But when it did, it was a surprisingly amazing show.
            Each episode was filled with action, storytelling, and great character development with a fast paced story. The idea of having a serial killer group seemed uninteresting at first
            but once again the show manages to subvert your expectations. Harrison Morgan is a lot more likeable than in New Blood, and Angel Batista being on Dexter's trail is an interesting subplot.

        </div>
        <div class="season2title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 2 (2007)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season2text"> Season 2 is the best season of the original Dexter series. The confrontation of Dexter vs. Doakes was amazing. Doakes was never someone to hate,
            he was always adding tension while being hilarious. It was sad to see his end on this season, but it was good that he wasn't dragged out. Lundy was also an amazing character
            added tension to the plot, making us fear that Dexter Morgan was going to be convicted as the Bay Harbor Butcher. This was an awesome season, awesome story, and amazing
            storytelling.

        <div class="season4img">

            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season4title"> <h1> 3. <br> Season 4 (2009)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season4text"> Season 4 has the best antagonist of the whole franchise. Dexter uses the Trinity Killer to learn how to manage both family life and serial killer life.
            Their journey was intriguing along with John Lithgow and Michael C. Hall putting their best performances. The secondary antagonists were also just as entertaining, and shows us
            more about Dexter being a family man after he is married to Rita. Speaking of Rita, what happens to her at the end of Season 4 is devastating. As soon as that phone rang in her purse,
            we knew what was going to happen, but we didn't want to see it. All in all, a really great season. 
        </div>

        <div class="season1img">
            <a href="images/season1.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter - Season 1">
                <img src="images/season1.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season1title"> <h1> 4. <br> Season 1 (2006)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season1text"> The classic season that started it all. This season had the best vibes, and introduces us to the main cast who we are familiar with.  
            This season interests us by keeping us wondering who the ice truck killer up until the reveal. We get to know about what Dexter does, why he does it, and who he kills.
            Doakes and Dexter's interactions were entertaining to see. While the season may start a little slow, it gets you hooked to know more. 
        </div>

        <div class="season7img">
            <a href="images/season7.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter - Season 7">
                <img src="images/season7.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season7title"> <h1> 5. <br> Season 7 (2012)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season7text"> Season 7 is another great season, although it doesn't match the superiority of Seasons 1, 2, and 4. The storyline of Dexter going against a Russian
            mob boss and eventually sympathizing and becoming friends with him is one of the best arcs of the season. It completely contrasts Season 3 when you think about it. 
            Dexter's lieutenant sister finding out who Dexter really is was also handled well, and we get to see her life starting to deteriorate, especially in the end. LaGuerta investigating
            Dexter after finding a blood slide leads to her re-investigating the Bay Harbor Butcher case was also a suspenseful storyline. Another good season in the books.

        <div class="season3img">
            <a href="images/season3.png" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter - Season 3">
                <img src="images/season3.png" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season3title"> <h1> 6. <br> Season 3 (2008)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season3text"> This season introduces us to the idea of what if a serial killer teams up with another person. This season was also good, around the same level as Season 7.
            I liked seeing Dexter and Miguel turning from friends to enemies as he strips away from the code of killing serial killers. It did feel like Miguel was rushed towards the end,
            and that is the only thing that sets back this season. Other than that, another good season in the books.
        </div>

        <div class="season9img">
            <a href="images/season9.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter: New Blood / Season 9">
                <img src="images/season9.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season9title"> <h1> 7. <br> Season 9 - Dexter: New Blood (2021-22)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season9text"> Dexter: New Blood tries to bring back Dexter as a way to rewrite how it ends, but in doing so, it fails to complete the story of Dexter yet again.
            The main storyline was okay, although the pacing was slow. We get to see Dexter bond with a fully grown Harrison, which doesn't even pay off because of how it ends.
            Overall this was an okay season outside of the ending. 
        </div>

        <div class="season10img">
            <a href="images/season10.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter: Original Sin / Season 10">
                <img src="images/season10.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season10title"> <h1> 8. <br> Season 10 - Dexter: Original Sin (2024-25)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season10text"> Dexter: Original Sin is the prequel to Dexter. The new actors that are meant to replicate the original show's actors do a 
            good job imitating their character and have the looks for how a young version of an actor should look. The antagonist wasn't really interesting n'or was he that big of a threat.
            Overall this was just a mediocre season. 
        </div>

        <div class="season5img">
            <a href="images/season5.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter - Season 5">
                <img src="images/season5.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season5title"> <h1> 9. <br> Season 5 (2010)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season5text"> This season starts Dexter's downfall after the events of Season 4, as well as literally the downfall of the show itself. The main antagonist wasn't that entertaining, n'or did we understand why he does what he did. 
            The bond of Dexter and Lumen revisits the idea of a vigilante killer team and it kind of works, although Lumen leaves after this season which makes the plot a little redundant to Dexter's story in the first place.
            This was just a superficial season at it's best. 
        </div>

        <div class="season6img">
            <a href="images/season6.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter - Season 6">
                <img src="images/season6.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season6title"> <h1> 10. <br> Season 6 (2011)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season6text"> The serial killer for this season just wasn't entertaining to watch, and there were a few plot holes and conveniences. If anything, the subplots of Dexter
            killing other serial killers aside from his forensics job was more interesting. There is not much to say other than the ending being a shocking twist. Not a good season though.
        </div>

        <div class="season8img">
            <a href="images/season8.jpg" data-lightbox="dexter-set" data-title="Dexter - Season 8">
                <img src="images/season8.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="season8title"> <h1> 11. <br> Season 8 (2013)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season8text"> This season was supposed to be the end of Dexter, and it fails miserably. This season was unbearable to watch, it was annoying how one of the main character dies for no reason 
            and doesn't get their happy ending after Season 7 happened. The story was built like it forgot what an ending is supposed to be and forgot what Dexter builds up to. 
            I will say though, this has the coolest season poster, I like how Dexter becomes wrapped which indicates his end and the show's end.
