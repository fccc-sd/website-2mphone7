        <div class="season11title"> <h1> 1. <br> Season 11 - Dexter: Resurrection (2025)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season11text"> Dexter: Resurrection Season 1 is the best season of the Dexter franchise, also being the most recent. </div>

        <div class="season2img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season2title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 2 (2007)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season2text"> Season 2 is the best season of the original Dexter series. </div>

        <div class="season4img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season4title"> <h1> 3. <br> Season 4 (2009)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season4text"> Season 4 has the best serial killer villain, and the ending was the most heartwrenching. </div>

        <div class="season1img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season1title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 1 (2006)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season1text"> The classic season that started it all. This had the best vibes, and kept you curious on who the ice truck killer. </div>

        <div class="season7img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season7title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 7 (2012)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season7text"> Season 7's main "villain" had you sympathize for him and he was a great character. LaGuerta vs Dexter was also a good storyline. </div>

        <div class="season3img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season3title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 3 (2008)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season3text"> This season's villain was good but felt rushed towards the end, but it was interesting to see Dexter team up with another. </div>

        <div class="season9img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season9title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 9 - Dexter: New Blood (2021-22)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season9text"> This revival was ok but their attempt to end the Dexter Franchise for good was a complete mess that Resurrection had to be made. </div>

        <div class="season10img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season10title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 10 - Dexter: Original Sin (2024-25)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season10text"> This prequel series was ok in highlighting Dexter's past, but it wasn't really entertaining. </div>

        <div class="season5img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season5title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 5 (2010)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season5text"> This season started Dexter's downfall (the show and the character), and the main antagonist wasn't that entertaining. Lumen could've been more interesting. </div>

        <div class="season8img"><img src="images/season1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="season8title"> <h1> 2. <br> Season 8 (2013)</h1> </div>
        <div class="season8text"> This season was absolutely boring to watch, it was annoying how one of the main character dies for no reason and doesn't get their happy ending after Season 7 happened. </div>
