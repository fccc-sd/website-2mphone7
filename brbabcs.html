            Breaking Bad (2008-2013) is a show about a chemistry teacher, Walter White, who is unable to make ends meet, so he partners with Jesse Pinkman to manufacture meth. 
            Better Call Saul (2015-2022) is a show about a lawyer who turns from good to sketchy, how he eventually becomes Walter White / Heisenberg's lawyer. 
            Breaking Bad has received several Primetime Emmy Awards and Nominations and Better Call Saul has several nominations, but with no Emmy Awards unfortunately. 
            This will not include El Camino as part of the ratings.

        <div class="bb5title"> <h1> 1. <br> Breaking Bad: Season 5 (2012-13)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bb5text"> This was the best season of breaking bad as well as the whole franchise. We get to see Walter White's rise as the drug lord as well as his demise
            as a family man. This whole season was pure cinema and if the doctor said I'd have trouble remebering from a concussion, I hope I didn't remember anything from this season
            because I would want to watch this season in its entirety blindly again. Overall, an 11/10 season.

        <div class="bb4title"> <h1> 2. <br> Breaking Bad: Season 4 (2011)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bb4text"> This season was also godly amazing. Gus Fring was amazing as a villain, we were both rooting for him and also going against him at the same time.
            We understood his character, his motives, and he created suspense for our main character who we fear anything will happen to him. The Walter White and Gus Fring showdown 
            was one of the best of the show. Walter uses his manipulation skills on Jesse yet again to survive. Another great season in Breaking Bad's books.

        <div class="bcs6title"> <h1> 3. <br> Better Call Saul: Season 6 (2022)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bcs6text"> This was easily the best season of Better Call Saul, and it's almost up there with Breaking Bad Seasons 4 and 5. Lalo Salamanca was a thrilling
            and charismatic villain and what he does to one of our main characters is devastating and shocking. I loved Nacho's send off as he doesn't give either of his enemies the satisfaction of killing him. 
            Both the lawyer plot and cartel plot kept you interested and it pays off at the end, in a heartbreaking way. 
            Kim's departure from the show completely changes Saul which is how we end up with the Saul we see in Breaking Bad. The last 4 episodes
            were slow at first but the ending was amazingly built. A great departure to the franchise as a whole.

        <div class="bcs5title"> <h1> 4. <br> Better Call Saul: Season 5 (2020)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bcs5text"> This was the second best season of Better Call Saul. Lalo Salamanca is now promoted to the main cast, and he was a joy of a character to watch. It gives 
            us another side of the Salamanca Family, how he is dangerous like all of them but puts on a friendly mask very easily. The last four episodes were amazing to watch, both 
            the cartel and lawyer plots intertween and Saul having to defend Lalo Salamanca were a treat to watch. It seems like all odds are against Saul but comes out on top as always.
            Another great season, just being Season 6.

        <div class="bb3title"> <h1> 5. <br> Breaking Bad: Season 3 (2010)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bb3text"> Another good season that doesn't miss. This season promotes Gus Fring to main character cast and it makes viewers tense about him. Walter White 
            and Jesse Pinkman's bond shows to be stronger than ever. Pinkman shoots a guy to save his partner's life, when episodes earlier they were arguing. This had good storytelling 
            and is almost up there with the other seasons. 
        </div>

        <div class="bcs4title"> <h1> 6. <br> Better Call Saul: Season 4 (2018)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bcs4text"> The death of Jimmy's brother further turns him into the Saul we know. Jimmy becomes more entangled in the criminal world, and Mike Ehrmantraut 
            teams up with Gus Fring, further explaining their partnership in Breaking Bad. This season introduces the show's new big bad: Lalo Salamanca. He replaces Hector
            Salamanca's spot, making Nacho's life harder. This season was also entertaining, although the first half is a little forgettable.

        <div class="bcs3title"> <h1> 7. <br> Better Call Saul: Season 3 (2017)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bcs3text"> This was another good season, and there is a clear highlight of this show. The Jimmy and Chuck confrontation was perfectly executed after two seasons of building it up.
            This shows Hector Salamanca and his authority and power of the cartel, which was also an interesting subplot. Another good season up with Season 4.

        <div class="bb2title"> <h1> 8. <br> Breaking Bad: Season 2 (2009)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bb2text"> This was an alright season. The highlights of the season was the demise of Tuco Salamanca and the introduction to Saul Goodman and Gus Fring.
            Although the storytelling was good, the pacing was a little slow. This season is necessary to set up the others though.

        <div class="bcs1title"> <h1> 9. <br> Better Call Saul: Season 1 (2015)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bcs1text"> The introduction to Jimmy McGill, who has not yet transformed into Saul Goodman. This season introduces us to our main colorful cast.
            This also shows us why and how Jimmy McGill is entangled with the cartel, which becomes important in the later seasons and partially in Breaking Bad. We believed Howard 
            was the bad guy but it turns out to be Jimmy's brother all along, which was a good twist. A great starter season. 
        </div>

        <div class="bb1title"> <h1> 10. <br> Breaking Bad: Season 1 (2008)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bb1text"> The introduction to the franchise as a whole. This showed us how Walter's life was boring and why he decides to pursue a criminal career out of making meth.
            His character growth to becoming Heisenberg was interesting. Jesse Pinkman was hilarious and sort of the comedic relief in this season. Another great starter season. 
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="bcs2title"> <h1> 11. <br> Better Call Saul: Season 2 (2016)</h1> </div>
        <div class="bcs2text"> This felt like the weakest season of Better Call Saul. While it was important to the story, the pacing felt slow and the cartel plot was the only thing 
            that felt like the highlight of the season. We get to see Mike Ehrmantraut further involved with the cartel as well as how he evolves. The build up to introduce Gus in season 3 was awesome.
            Overall, this season felt forgettable, but once you remember it, it is a good season that is needed to make BCS how it is in the later seasons.
